# 🥋UFC Data Warehouse
Welcome to the UFC Data Warehouse and Analytics repository! 
This project demonstrates a comprehensive data warehousing and analytics solution using real-world style UFC datasets. From building a star schema warehouse to generating actionable insights, this project is designed as a portfolio showcase of industry best practices in data engineering and analytics.
## Project Requirements
Building the Data Warehouse (Data Engineering)
## Objective
Develop a modern data warehouse in SQL Server to consolidate MMA data (events, fights, fighters, and fighter stats), enabling analytical reporting and performance tracking.

Design and implement a **star schema data warehouse** in SQL Server to consolidate UFC event, fight,fight Stats  and fighter data. The warehouse should support analytical queries about fighter performance, fight outcomes, and event trends.

## Source Data (CSVs)
*events.csv* → event details (metadata about each event)

*fighters.csv* → fighter profile information

*fighter_stats.csv* → aggregate performance statistics per fighter

*fights.csv* → records of individual fight outcomes

## Warehouse Design
## 🏗Facts (actions/transactions)
### FactFights (core fact table)
fight_id

event_id (FK → DimEvent)

fighter1_id (FK → DimFighter)

fighter2_id (FK → DimFighter)

winner_id (FK → DimFighter)

method_id (FK → DimMethod)

round, time, fight_duration, date_id (FK → DimDate)

## (Optional)
**FactFighterStats** → if you want to keep fighter_stats.csv as a separate fact for per-fighter aggregated performance.


## 🧾Dimensions (descriptive attributes)
### DimFighter
fighter_id, name, country, stance, height, reach, dob
## DimEvent
event_id, event_name, event_date, location
## DimDate
date_id, full_date, day, month, year, quarter
## DimMethod
method_id, method_type (KO/TKO, Decision, Submission, etc.)

##(and optionally FactFighterStats linked to DimFighter)

## Analytics Requirements
### Fighter Performance
Win/Loss ratio per fighter

Fighters with the most finishes (KO/Submissions)

Average fight duration per fighter

### Event Analytics
Events with the most fights

Top locations by number of events

Event activity trend (fights per year/quarter)

### Fight Trends
Most common winning method overall

Round distribution of finishes (most fights ending in round 1, etc.)

Country-level fighter performance comparison

## Deliverables
Data Warehouse Schema (star schema implemented in SQL Server)

ETL Process (staging CSVs → cleansing → load to DW)

SQL Queries for insights above

**Documentation:**
ERD (star schema diagram)

Data dictionary (tables + columns)

README in GitHub

This version is industry-standard:
No ERP/CRM shortcut labels

Pure Fact + Dimension modeling (Kimball method)

Easy for any engineer/analyst to understand


Project Requirements
Building the Data Warehouse (Data Engineering)
Objective
Develop a modern data warehouse in SQL Server to consolidate MMA data (events, fights, fighters, and fighter stats), enabling analytical reporting and performance tracking.
Specifications
Data Sources: Import data from CSV files (events, fights, fighters, fighter_stats).
Data Quality: Cleanse and resolve data quality issues (duplicates, missing values, inconsistent formats).
Integration: Combine all sources into a unified, user-friendly star schema designed for analytical queries.
Scope: Focus on the latest available datasets; historization is not required.
Documentation: Provide clear documentation of the data model, transformations, and queries for both technical and non-technical stakeholders.
BI: Analytics & Reporting (Data Analytics)
Objective
Develop SQL-based analytics to deliver detailed insights into:
Fighter Performance (win/loss ratios, finish rates, average fight duration)
Event Analytics (most active venues, event activity over time, fights per event)
Fight Trends (most common winning methods, round/time distributions, country-level comparisons)
